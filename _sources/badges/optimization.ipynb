    "# Requirements to Earn the “Optimization in Python” Badge\n",

    ":width: 200px\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To earn this badge, complete **all** of the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Fundamentals**  \n",
    "   - In your own words, explain the terms `objective function`, `decision variable`, `constraint`, `gradient`, and `Hessian`.  \n",
    "   - Describe the difference between **unconstrained** and **constrained** optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unconstrained Minimization**  \n",
    "   - Using SciPy’s `minimize`, solve:  \n",
    "     - A one-dimensional quadratic (e.g. `f(x) = x**2 + 3*x + 2`).  \n",
    "     - A two-dimensional Rosenbrock or saddle-type function.  \n",
    "   - Submit your code, a plot of the function landscape (with the optimum marked), and a brief write-up of your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constrained Optimization**  \n",
    "   - Formulate and solve one **equality-constrained** and one **inequality-constrained** problem (e.g. minimize cost subject to a mass‐balance or allocate resources under budget limits).  \n",
    "   - Show how you encoded constraints in SciPy, share your code, and summarize the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Global Search Methods**  \n",
    "   - Apply **differential evolution** or **basin‐hopping** to a multimodal test function (e.g. Rastrigin).  \n",
    "   - Compare its result to a local solver’s result. Include code snippets and your interpretation of why the global method succeeded (or failed).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytic vs. Numeric Derivatives**  \n",
    "   - Write a custom function with both an analytic **Jacobian** (gradient) and **Hessian**, and plug these into SciPy’s solvers.  \n",
    "   - Solve the same problem using finite-difference derivatives (e.g. via `numdifftools`) and compare:  \n",
    "     1. Number of function calls  \n",
    "     2. Convergence speed  \n",
    "     3. Final accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Automatic Differentiation with JAX**  \n",
    "   - Reproduce one of your earlier optimization examples using JAX’s `jax.jacfwd` (and optionally `jax.hessian`) to supply exact derivatives.  \n",
    "   - Show your code and comment on any performance or accuracy improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Case Study – Reactor Cost Minimization**  \n",
    "   - Using the worked example in Chapter 4, formulate the reactor‐cost minimization problem, choose appropriate methods, and find the cost-minimizing design.  \n",
    "   - Provide your full notebook or script, plus a short report (1–2 pages) highlighting key insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Reflection & Presentation**  \n",
    "   - Write a **300-word summary** of what you learned about optimization in Python—challenges you faced, tips you’d pass on, and how you might apply these tools in your own STEM work.  \n",
    "   - Present your summary (with code highlights and plots) to your counselor in person or via video conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Portfolio Development\n",
    "Create a comprehensive portfolio including:\n",
    "- Well-documented Python code for all major problems solved\n",
    "- Clear visualizations and plots with proper labels and legends\n",
    "- Written explanations of your methodology for each problem\n",
    "- Comparison of different solution approaches where applicable\n",
    "- Discussion of computational efficiency and accuracy considerations\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Badge Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Skills (40%):** Demonstrated proficiency with computational tools, correct implementation of algorithms, and proper solution validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem-Solving (25%):** Ability to set up, analyze, and solve increasingly complex nonlinear problems with appropriate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication (20%):** Clear presentation skills, effective peer teaching, and well-documented portfolio materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application & Reflection (15%):** Connection to real-world problems, thoughtful reflection on methods and results, and demonstrated understanding of when to apply different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have a peer sign off that you have completed the requirements.\n",
    "2. Present the portfolio to a TA for final approval. "
