    "# Requirements to Earn the *Differential Equations in Python* Badge\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To earn your optional silver-blue badge, complete **all** of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial-Value Mastery**  \n",
    "   - Solve **three** distinct initial-value problems (IVPs) with  `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`  \n",
    "     including at least one **stiff** system (e.g. a chemical-kinetics model).  \n",
    "   - For each IVP, compare two solvers (e.g. `RK45` vs. `BDF`), discuss accuracy vs. performance, and submit annotated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase-Plane Explorer**  \n",
    "   - Choose a 2D non-linear system (e.g. Van der Pol oscillator or predatorâ€“prey model).  \n",
    "   - Generate a phase portrait (quiver plot + trajectories), label fixed points, and interpret their stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Boundary-Value Problem (BVP) Solver**  \n",
    "   - Formulate and solve a real-world BVP (e.g. steady-state diffusion or beam deflection) using  \n",
    "     `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp`  \n",
    "   - Produce solution-profile plots and explain your choice of mesh and boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Event Detection & Control**  \n",
    "   - Implement an ODE with an **event function** (e.g. stop integration when $y(t)=0.5$ or detect a local maximum).  \n",
    "   - Plot the solution, mark the event points, and describe how you detected them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameterized Sweeps**  \n",
    "   - Write a routine that integrates your ODE over a **range of parameter values**.  \n",
    "   - Collate results into a single figure (e.g. overlaid solution curves) and explain how parameter changes affect the dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Dense-Output & Interpolation**  \n",
    "   - Use the `dense_output` feature of `solve_ivp` to interpolate your solution at intermediate times.  \n",
    "   - Compare interpolated values to a high-resolution numerical or analytical solution, discussing any interpolation artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Mini-Project Presentation**  \n",
    "   - Package your best example (IVP, BVP, or phase portrait) as a mini-project:  \n",
    "     - A well-commented Python script or Jupyter notebook  \n",
    "     - Clear plots with captions  \n",
    "     - A one-page README summarizing methodology, results, and key takeaways  \n",
    "   - Present your mini-project to a peer or mentor (in person or via screen-share) and collect feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Portfolio Development**\n",
    "Create a comprehensive portfolio including:\n",
    "- Well-documented Python code for all major problems solved\n",
    "- Clear visualizations and plots with proper labels and legends\n",
    "- Written explanations of your methodology for each problem\n",
    "- Comparison of different solution approaches where applicable\n",
    "- Discussion of computational efficiency and accuracy considerations\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Badge Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Skills (40%):** Demonstrated proficiency with computational tools, correct implementation of algorithms, and proper solution validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem-Solving (25%):** Ability to set up, analyze, and solve increasingly complex nonlinear problems with appropriate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication (20%):** Clear presentation skills, effective peer teaching, and well-documented portfolio materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application & Reflection (15%):** Connection to real-world problems, thoughtful reflection on methods and results, and demonstrated understanding of when to apply different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have a peer sign off that you have completed the requirements.\n",
    "2. Present the portfolio to a TA for final approval. "
